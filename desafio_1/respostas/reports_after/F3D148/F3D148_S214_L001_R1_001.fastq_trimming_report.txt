Trimming mode: single-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.4_dev
Cutadapt version: 2.8
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 25
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count smallRNA: 0, count Nextera: 0, count Illumina: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; default (inconclusive auto-detection))
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length before a sequence gets removed: 20 bp
Maxiumum tolerated read length after trimming (for smallRNA trimming): 250 bp
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Output file will be GZIP compressed

=== Adapter 1 ===

Sequence: AGATCGGAAGAGC; Type: regular 3'; Length: 13; Trimmed: 8934 times; Reverse-complemented: 0 times

No. of allowed errors:
0-9 bp: 0; 10-13 bp: 1

Bases preceding removed adapters:
  A: 7.7%
  C: 89.0%
  G: 1.0%

  none/other: 0.0%
WARNING:
    The adapter is preceded by "C" extremely often.
    The provided adapter sequence could be incomplete at its 3' end.
