Input filename: F3D8_S196_L001_R1_001.fastq
Trimming mode: single-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.4_dev
Cutadapt version: 2.8
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 25
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count smallRNA: 0, count Nextera: 0, count Illumina: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; default (inconclusive auto-detection))
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length before a sequence gets removed: 20 bp
Maxiumum tolerated read length after trimming (for smallRNA trimming): 250 bp
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Output file will be GZIP compressed
